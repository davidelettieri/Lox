# Lox
C# implementation of Lox from https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/

I just ported all the code from the original Java implementation. Some changes were necessary for fixing keywords and methods naming conventions from Java to C#.

# Tests

Tests were copied as is from the implementation, I used a console app to build the test cases from the .lox files in the test folders.
